we have multiple components in our system
  1. api gateway
    we used api gateway to help us manage our microservices architecture
    - load balancing
    - routing
    - authentication
    - rate liming
  2. user service
    this service is used to handle all operations related to user like 
    - register new users
    - login
    - update user details
  3. Movie service 
    this service is used to handle all operations related to movie like 
    - add movie
  4. review service
    this service is used to handle all operations related to review like 
    - add new review
  5. movie cache
    we used caching to ensure low latency for search, we can analyze the most popular search queries and cache based on them
    we also can use elastic search to ensure full text search and more performant movie retrieval
  6. Object Storage
    we used object storage like S3 for better static files retrieval
  7. CDN
    also we used CDNs which is a type of caching to ensure the retrieval of static files is faster 
  8. encoding
    These are multiple servers that are specialized in encoding and compressing videos(trailers) 
  9. queue
    this is async queue that we will queue videos to it
  the communication between the services will be done using gRPC which will make the communication faster and cheaper
  the problem with grpc is it's protol buffers which is hard to read for humans but still it's better than rest in this case
